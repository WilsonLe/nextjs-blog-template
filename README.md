# How to edit

To edit text on the webpage, navigate to folder **config**, open **index.ts**. This file contains text value for the entire website, stored in JSON format. The details and descriptions are specified in the file.

# How to upload

- To upload personal blogs, go to folder public/blogs, and add the markdown file of the blog.
- To upload images, go to folder public/images, and add images in customizable folders. When referencing images, note that the base directory is public. So referencing an image "public/images/logo.jpeg" will be "/images/logo.jpeg"
- **IMPORTANT**:
  - When uploading blogs, the markdown file must not have white space between the letters. For instance:
    - "my first blog post" is **invalid**.
    - "my-first-blog-post" is **valid**.
  - The markdown files must have a valid header, which includes:
    - title: the title of the blog post
    - order: the order in which the blog post appear. Largest will be placed on the top left, smallest will be placed on the bottom right.
    - thumbnailURL: Thumbnail of the blog post
    - thumbnailAlt: Description of the thumbnail. Useful when readers can't load thumbnail, this text will be displayed instead.
    - description: Short description of the blog post.

# How to deploy

The easiest way to deploy and host NextJS application is by using [Vercel](https://vercel.com). Here is the link on how to deploy a NextJS project on Vercel: [Deploying Your Next.js Project with Vercel](https://vercel.com/guides/deploying-nextjs-with-vercel#step-2:-deploying-your-next.js-project-with-vercel).

However, if you wish you deploy on your own server, you can build and deploy with the following commands:

1. Build production-ready NextJS application

```
yarn build
```

2. Start NextJS application:

```
yarn start
```

Here are several server hosting services that I know:

- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com)
- [GCP](https://cloud.google.com)
- [Linode](https://linode.com)
- [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com)
- [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
- [Heroku](https://heroku.com)
